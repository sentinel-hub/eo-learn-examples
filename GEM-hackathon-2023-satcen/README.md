## About the hackathon

 ### Description:


 ### Tentative Agenda:




 ### Requirements:
 This [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#what-is-a-binder) repository was set up so that you can participate with no pre-requirement to be installed on your side.
 However, the notebook must target a computing environment with 2 GB of RAM. After some inactivity, the docker container is culled. Access to a web browser should be enough for your successful participation.

 ### Target Participants:
 Students, Software developers, Data scientists, EO-developers, anyone with an interest in the topic.

 ### Time requirements:

 45 minutes
