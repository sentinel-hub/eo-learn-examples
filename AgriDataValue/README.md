# AgriDataValue toolbox demonstrators

Within the [AgriDataValue](https://agridatavalue.eu) project, part of the federated capabilities come from the Sentinel Hub, eo-learn and eo-grow toolkit.

In this folder we show some examples how the toolbox can be used to perform tasks related to dealing with the data, indicators, using resources on Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE) and climate change monitoring and modelling.

## Table of Contents

 * [./data_search.ipynb](data_search.ipynb): querying Earth Observation data

 * [./eo-data.ipynb](eo-data.ipynb): retrieving EO data

 * [./indicators.ipynb](indicators.ipynb): access to EO derived data for various existing indicators (e.g. Soil Moisture)

 * [./ndvi_example.ipynb](ndvi_example.ipynb): example how to retrieve NDVI data using Sentinel Hub Process API

 * [./cdse_example](cdse_example.ipynb): how to set up toolkit to work with CDSE

 * [Air pollution](./Air pollution example): retrieving, visualising and analysing NO2 air pollution with the data from the Sentinel-5P satellite

 * [Burned up area](./Burned-up_area) : an example of how Sentinel Hub can be used together with eo-learn and eo-grow to train and deploy a model for burned up area detection

 * [Cloud shadows projection](./cloud-shadows-projection): Example showing how to use the toolbox to compute sloud shadows. Showing advanced capabilities ot the toolbox for complex processing tasks.

   ### Examples focusing on  ADV datasets and integration:

 * [Satellite imagery data](./satellite_imagery_data.ipynb): example showing how to retrieve satellite imagery over a pilot AoI for longitudal agricultural monitoring.

 * [Drone data](./drone_data_w_imagery.ipynb): Example showing how the drone data integrated into the toolbox can be retrieved alongside satellite imagery

 * [Historical indcators](./historical_indicators_statistics): Example showing how historical indicators can be retrieved and processed over pilot areas

 * [Projection indicators](./projection_indicators_statistics.ipynb): Example showing how 5-year and 50 year projection indicators can be retrieved and processed
