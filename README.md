# eo-learn-examples

**eo-learn makes extraction of valuable information from satellite imagery easy. This is where we show you how.**

The availability of open Earth observation (EO) data through the Copernicus and Landsat programs represents an unprecedented resource for many EO applications, ranging from ocean and land use and land cover monitoring, disaster control, emergency services and humanitarian relief. Given the large amount of high spatial resolution data at high revisit frequency, techniques able to automatically extract complex patterns in such _spatio-temporal_ data are needed.

**`eo-learn`** _library acts as a bridge between Earth observation/Remote sensing field and Python ecosystem for data science and machine learning._ The library is written in Python and uses NumPy arrays to store and handle remote sensing data. Its aim is to make entry easier for non-experts to the field of remote sensing on one hand and bring the state-of-the-art tools for computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning existing in Python ecosystem to remote sensing experts.

The **`eo-learn-examples`** repository contains example Earth observation workflows that extract valuable information from satellite imagery, giving you hints and ideas how to use the EO data.

## Sentinel-Hub account

In order to run (some of) the examples you  need a Sentinel Hub account. You can get a trial version [here](https://www.sentinel-hub.com).

Once you have the account set up, login to [Sentinel Hub Configurator](https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/configurator/). By default you will already have the default confoguration with an **instance ID** (alpha-numeric code of length 36). For these examples it is recommended that you create a new configuration (`"Add new configuration"`) and set the configuration to be based on **Python scripts template**. Such configuration will already contain all layers used in these examples. Otherwise you will have to define the layers for your  configuration yourself.

After you have decided which configuration to use, you have two options You can either put configuration's **instance ID** into `sentinelhub` package's configuration file following the [configuration instructions](http://sentinelhub-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configure.html) or you can write it down in the example notebooks.

##  Overview

TODO

## Installation

Generally, examples should run with having latest `eo-learn` installed. In other cases, the example should come with instructions how to set-up environment in order to be able to run it.
