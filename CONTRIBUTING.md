## Pull Requests

The GitHub Pull Request (PR) mechanism is the best option to contribute code to the library. Users can fork the repository, make their contribution to their local fork and create a PR to add those changes to the codebase. GitHub provides excellent tutorials on how the [fork and pull][fork-and-pull] mechanism work, and on how to best [create a PR][create-pr].

Existing PRs can be found [here][existing-prs]. Before creating new PRs, you should check whether someone else has contributed a similar feature, and if so, you can add your input to the existing code review.

The following guidelines should be observed when creating a PR.
